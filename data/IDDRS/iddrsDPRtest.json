There are four overall objectives of PI\/SC: \\n To inform stakeholders about the DDR process (public information): This includes providing tailored key messages to various stakeholders, such as where to go, when to deposit weapons, who is eligible for DDR and what reintegration options are available. The result is that DDR participants, beneficiaries and other stakeholders are made fully aware of what the DDR process involves. This kind of messaging also serves the purpose of making communities understand how the DDR process will involve them. Most importantly, it serves to manage expectations, clearly defining what falls within and outside the scope of DDR. If the DDR process is made up of different combinations of DDR programmes, DDR-related tools or reintegration support, messages should clearly define who is eligible for what. Given that, historically, women and girls have not always received the same information as male combatants, as they may be purposely hidden by male commanders or may have \u2018self-demobilized\u2019, it is essential that PI\/SC strategies take into consideration the specific information channels required to reach them. It is important to note, however, that PI activities cannot compensate for a faulty DDR process, or on their own convince people that it is safe to participate. If combatants are not willing to disarm, for whatever reason, PI alone will not persuade them to do so. In such sitatutions, strategic communications may be used to create the conditions for a successful DDR process. \\n To mitigate the negative impact of misinformation and disinformation (strategic communication): It is important to understand how conflict actors such as armed groups and other stakeholders respond, react to and\/or provide alternative messages that are disseminated in support of the DDR process. In the volatile conflict and post-conflict contexts in which DDR takes place, those who profit(ed) from war or who believe their political objectives have not been met may not wish to see the DDR process succeed. They may have access to radio stations from which they can make broadcasts or may distribute pamphlets and other materials spreading \u2018hate\u2019 or messages that incite violence and undermine the UN and\/or some of the (former) warring parties. These spoilers likely will have access to online platforms, such as blogs and social media, where they can easily reach and influence a large number of people. It is therefore critical that PI\/SC extends beyond merely providing information to the public. A comprehensive PI\/SC strategy shall be designed to identify and address sources of misinformation and disinformation and to develop tailored strategic communication interventions. Implementation should be iterative, whereby messages are deployed to provide alternative narratives for specific misinformation or disinformation that may hamper the implementation of a DDR process. \\n To sensitize members of armed forces and groups to the DDR process (strategic communication): Strategic communication interventions can be used to sensitize potential DDR participants. That is, beyond informing stakeholders, beneficiaries and participants about the details of the DDR process and beyond mitigating the negative impacts of misinformation and disinformation, strategic communication can be used to influence the decisions of individuals who are considering leaving their armed force or group including providing the necessary information to leave safely. The transformative objective of strategic communication interventions should be context specific and based on a concrete understanding of the political aspects of the conflict, the grievances of members of armed forces and groups, and an analysis of the potential motivations of individuals to join\/leave warring parties. Strategic communication interventions may include messages targeting active combatants to encourage their participation in the DDR process, for example, stories and testimonials from ex-combatants and other positive DDR impact stories. They may also include communication campaigns aimed at preventing recruitment. The potential role of the national authorities should also be assessed through analysis and where possible, national authorities should lead the strategic communication. \\n To transform attitudes in communities so as to foster DDR (strategic communication): Reintegration and\/or CVR programmes are often crucial elements of DDR processes (see IDDRS 2.30 on Community Violence Reduction and IDDRS 4.30 on Reintegration). Strategic communication interventions can help to create conditions that facilitate peacebuilding and social cohesion and encourage the peaceful return of former members of armed forces and groups to civilian life. Communities are not homogeneous entities, and individuals within a single community may have differing attitudes towards the return of former members of armed forces and groups. For example, those who have been hit hardest by the conflict may be more likely to have negative perceptions of returning combatants. Others may simply be happy to be reunited with family members. The DDR process may also be negatively perceived as rewarding combatants. When necessary, strategic communication can be used as a means to transform the perceptions of communities and to combat stigmatization, hate speech, marginalization and discrimination against former members of armed forces and groups. Women and girls are often stigmatized in receiving communities and PI\/SC can play a pivotal role in creating a more supportive environment for them. PI\/SC should also be utilized to promote non-violent behaviour, including engaging men and boys as allies in promoting positive masculine norms (see IDDRS 5.10 on Women, Gender and DDR). Finally, PI\/SC should also be used to destigmatize the mental health impacts of conflict and raise awareness of psychosocial support services.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":2606}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"How long is the time between initial infection with HIV and the body's production of antibodies?","answers":["up to three months"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Glossary: Terms and Definitions","text":"The time period between initial infection with HIV and the body\u2019s production of antibodies, which can be up to three months.

By carrying out a stakeholder analysis (as part of a larger conflict assessment process), it will be possible to better understand the dynam- ics among national actors, and to identify DDR supporters and potential spoilers; \\n Institutional capacity development: It is important that capacity development strategies are established jointly with national authorities at the start of international involvement in DDR to ensure that the parties themselves take ownership of and responsibility for the success of the process. The UN system should play an important role in supporting the development of national and local capacities for DDR through providing technical assistance, establishing partnership arrangements with national institutions, and pro- viding training and capacity-building to local implementing partners; \\n Support for the establishment of legal frameworks: A key area in which international exper- tise can support the development of national capacities is in the drawing up of legal frameworks for DDR and related processes of SSR and weapons management. The UN system should draw on experiences from a range of political and legal systems, and assist national authorities in drafting appropriate legislation and legal instruments; \\n Technical assistance for policy and planning: Through the provision of technical assistance, the UN system should provide direct support to the development of national DDR policy and programmes. It is important to ensure, however, that this assistance is provided through partnership or mentoring arrangements that allow for knowledge and skills transfers to national staff, and to avoid situations where international experts take direct responsibility for programme functions within national institutions. When several international institutions are providing technical assistance to national authori- ties, it is important to ensure that this assistance is coordinated and coherent; \\n Direct support for implementation and financial management: The UN system may also be called upon, either by Security Council mandate or at the request of national authorities, to provide direct support for the implementation of certain components of a DDR pro- gramme, including the financial management of resources for DDR. A memorandum of understanding should be established between the UN and national authorities that defines the precise area of responsibility for programme delivery, mechanisms for co- ordination with local partners and clear reporting responsibilities; \\n Material\/Logistic support: In the post-conflict period, many national institutions lack both material and human resources. The UN system should provide material and logistic support to national DDR institutions and implementing agencies, particularly in the areas of: information and communications technology and equipment; transportation; rehabilitation, design and management of DDR sites, transit centres and other facilities; the establishment of information management and referral systems; and the procurement of basic goods for reinsertion kits, among others (also see IDDRS 4.10 on Disarmament, IDDRS 4.20 on Demobilization and IDDRS 4.30 on Social and Economic Reintegration); \\n Training programmes for national staff: The UN system should further support capacity development through the provision of training. There are a number of different training methodologies, including the provision of courses or seminars, training of trainers, on- the-job or continuous training, and exchanges with experts from other national DDR institutions. Although shortage of time and money may limit the training options that can be offered, it is important that the approach chosen builds skills through a continuous process of capacity development that transfers skills to local actors; \\n Support to local capacity development and community empowerment: Through local capacity development and community empowerment, the UN system should support local ownership of DDR processes and programmes. Since the success of the DDR process depends largely on the reintegration of individuals at the community level, it is im- portant to ensure that capacity development efforts are not restricted to assisting national authorities, but include direct support to communities in areas of reintegration. In particular, international agencies can help to build local capacities for participation in assessment and planning processes, project and financial management, reporting, and evaluation.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":2231}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What is the need for a dual focus on supporting transparent, inclusive national decision-making combined with the development of sustainable national capacities?","answers":["Weak institutions and limited capacities"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"DDR and Security Sector Reform","text":"Weak institutions and limited capacities are frequently cited as impediments to national ownership in post-conflict contexts.

They can do this by providing on-the-job learning, mentoring, including them in their networks and associations, and using youth businesses to supply their own businesses. The more support a young entrepreneur receives in the first years of their business, the better their chances of creating a sustainable business or of becoming more employable. \\n\\n ensure business-focused DDR activities align with national priorities and strategies in order to maximise potential access to resources and government support. \\n\\n provide access to business training. Among several business training methods, Start Your Business, for start-ups, and Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) help train people who train entrepreneurs and through this multiplier effect, reach a large number of unemployed or potential business starters.

This includes recordkeeping of weapons, ammunition and explosives collected during the disarmament phase of a DDR programme. Transparency in the disposal of weapons and ammunition collected from former conflict parties is key to building trust in the DDR programme. Destruction should not take place if there is a risk that judicial evidence may be lost as a result of the disposal, and especially where there is a risk of linkages to organized crime activities. Recordkeeping and tracing of weapons should be mandatory, and of ammunition where feasible. The use of digital technology should be deployed during recordkeeping, where possible, to allow for weapons tracing from the time of retrieval and throughout the management chain, enhancing accountability. For further information, see IDDRS 4.10 on Disarmament. \\nLink to wider SSR and arms control: Law enforcement agencies in conflict-affected countries often lack the capacity to investigate and prosecute weapons trafficking offenders and to collect and secure illegal weapons and ammunition. DDR practitioners should therefore align their efforts with broader arms control initiatives to ensure that weapons and ammunition management capacity deficits do not further contribute to illicit flows and the perpetration of armed violence. Understanding arms trafficking dynamics, achieved by ensuring collected weapons are marked and thus traceable, is critical to countering illicit arms flows.

With close attention to whether a robust framework is in place with respect to land rights, and sub-surface natural resource rights as a pre-cursor, engagement with private sector entities can help to facilitate these types of opportunities, whether for high-value natural resources or agricultural commodities with significant market value such as coffee, cocoa, grains or other soft commodities. The risk, however, is that the pressure to kick-start development and earn foreign exchange can lead to rapid, uncontrolled exploitation of such resources at sub-optimal prices, without due attention to land and sub-surface resource rights, environmental sustainability, employment creation and the equitable distribution of revenues. When the benefits are not shared, or when environmental degradation occurs as a consequence of exploitation, there could be serious potential for conflict to resume. \\n Developing sustainable livelihoods for peace: Sustainable peace fundamentally hinges on the development of sustainable livelihoods, the provision of basic services, and on the recovery and sound management (including equitable distribution of related benefits) of the natural resource base. Environmental damage caused by conflicts, coping strategies and chronic environmental problems (including climate change impacts) that undermine livelihoods must therefore be addressed from the outset. Minimizing vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change through the management of key natural resources and the introduction of appropriate technologies may also be addressed. Women and children are often disproportionally affected by environmental contamination economically, socially as well as in terms of their health and well-being. DDR practitioners should therefore seek to address the specific needs of women and children in relation to their dependence on natural resources and risks involved. Careful coordination and attention to issues of land access, tenure and the availability of agricultural inputs and access to financing are critical elements for ensuring success and sustainability. Women, and especially unmarried women and women who are not closely associated with a male relative, or those who face stigma or discrimination due to various other circumstances (i.e., sexual violence survivors, single mothers, unmarried women, etc.) are often disadvantaged in regard to access to capital assets as women\u2019s ownership rights are often based on de facto agreements through male community members and traditional gender roles may prevent women and girls from accessing education and capacity building. \\n Contributing to dialogue, reconciliation and confidence building: Natural resources can be a neutral entry point or catalyst for enhancing dialogue, building confidence, exploring shared interests and broadening cooperation between divided communities as well as within and between states. Such actions should aim to use an inclusive approach that seeks to consider and respond to the needs of the entire population, especially women and youth. Bringing communities together to discuss and resolve common challenges and concerns, such as access to water points and grazing lands, can be a powerful peacebuilding tool and can help to mitigate the risk of further conflict between competing natural resource user groups.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":323}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What is insufficient to allow for a sustainable DDR process and may cause harm?","answers":["A partial commitment"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"The Politics of DDR","text":"Donors and UN budgetary bodies should understand that DDR is a long and expen- sive undertaking.

Depending on where DDR practitioners are working along the peace continuum, the following are three key areas where risks and opportunities should be considered: \\n Supporting economic recovery: When natural resources are properly governed and carefully managed, \u201chigh-value\u201d resources (such as hydrocarbons, minerals, metals, stones and export timber) can form an important basis for employment creation and budget revenue for development. With close attention to whether a robust framework is in place with respect to land rights, and sub-surface natural resource rights as a pre-cursor, engagement with private sector entities can help to facilitate these types of opportunities, whether for high-value natural resources or agricultural commodities with significant market value such as coffee, cocoa, grains or other soft commodities. The risk, however, is that the pressure to kick-start development and earn foreign exchange can lead to rapid, uncontrolled exploitation of such resources at sub-optimal prices, without due attention to land and sub-surface resource rights, environmental sustainability, employment creation and the equitable distribution of revenues. When the benefits are not shared, or when environmental degradation occurs as a consequence of exploitation, there could be serious potential for conflict to resume. \\n Developing sustainable livelihoods for peace: Sustainable peace fundamentally hinges on the development of sustainable livelihoods, the provision of basic services, and on the recovery and sound management (including equitable distribution of related benefits) of the natural resource base. Environmental damage caused by conflicts, coping strategies and chronic environmental problems (including climate change impacts) that undermine livelihoods must therefore be addressed from the outset. Minimizing vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change through the management of key natural resources and the introduction of appropriate technologies may also be addressed. Women and children are often disproportionally affected by environmental contamination economically, socially as well as in terms of their health and well-being. DDR practitioners should therefore seek to address the specific needs of women and children in relation to their dependence on natural resources and risks involved. Careful coordination and attention to issues of land access, tenure and the availability of agricultural inputs and access to financing are critical elements for ensuring success and sustainability. Women, and especially unmarried women and women who are not closely associated with a male relative, or those who face stigma or discrimination due to various other circumstances (i.e., sexual violence survivors, single mothers, unmarried women, etc.) are often disadvantaged in regard to access to capital assets as women\u2019s ownership rights are often based on de facto agreements through male community members and traditional gender roles may prevent women and girls from accessing education and capacity building. \\n Contributing to dialogue, reconciliation and confidence building: Natural resources can be a neutral entry point or catalyst for enhancing dialogue, building confidence, exploring shared interests and broadening cooperation between divided communities as well as within and between states. Such actions should aim to use an inclusive approach that seeks to consider and respond to the needs of the entire population, especially women and youth. Bringing communities together to discuss and resolve common challenges and concerns, such as access to water points and grazing lands, can be a powerful peacebuilding tool and can help to mitigate the risk of further conflict between competing natural resource user groups.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":323}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"How do ex combatants and other war-affected individuals get the support, training, technical assitance and knowledge to vote?","answers":["form political parties and extend their civil and political rights"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Reintegration","text":"Political reintegration is the involvement and participation of ex-combatants and people associated with armed forces and groups\u2014and the communities to which they return\u2014in post-conflict decision- and policy-making processes at the national, regional and commu- nity levels.

\\n (v) Once identified, disarmed and separated from the refugee population, combat\u00ad ants should be interned at a safe location from the border; \\n (vi) Where the granting of refugee status is based on group determination, civilian family members of combatants should be treated as refugees and should not be interned together with them; \\n (vii) Combatants should not be considered as asylum\u00adseekers until the authorities have established within a reasonable timeframe that they have genuinely and permanently renounced military activities. Once this has been established, special procedures should be put in place for individual refugee status deter\u00ad mination, to ensure that those seeking asylum fulfil the criteria for the recogni\u00ad tion of refugee status.

Dealing with heavy weapons presents both logistical and political challenges. In certain settings, heavy weapons could be included in the eligibility criteria for a DDR programme, and the ratio of arms to combatants could be determined based on the number of crew required to operate each specific weapons system. However, while small arms and most light weapons are generally seen as an individual asset, heavy weapons are often considered a group asset, and thus may not be surrendered during disarmament operations that focus on individual combatants and persons associated with armed forces and groups. \\n To ensure comprehensive disarmament and avoid the exploitation of loopholes, peace negotiations and the national DDR programme should determine the procedures related to the arsenals of armed groups, including heavy weapons and\/or caches of materiel. Processing heavy weapons and their ammunition requires a high level of technical knowledge. Heavy-weapons systems can be complex and require specialist expertise to ensure that systems are made safe, unloaded and all items of ammunition are safely separated from the platform. Conducting a thorough weapons survey and planning is vital to ensure the correct expertise is made available. The UN DDR component in mission settings or UN lead agency(ies) in non-mission settings should provide advice with regards to the collection, storage and disposal of heavy weapons, and support the development of any related SOPs. Procedures regarding heavy weapons should be clearly communicated to armed forces and groups prior to any disarmament operations to avoid unorganized and unscheduled movements of heavy weapons that might foment further tensions among the population. Destruction of heavy weapons requires significant logistics (see section 8); it is therefore critical to ensure the physical security of these weapons in order to reduce the risk of diversion.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":2840}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What should potential protection issues and gender-specific barriers consider?","answers":["the delivery mechanism"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Demobilization","text":"Irrespective of the type of transfer modality selected, the delivery mechanism (cash, vouchers, mobile money transfer) should take into account potential protection issues and gender-specific barriers.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":1776}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"Why are PUPs selected?","answers":["their convenience, security and accessibility for all parties"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Disarmament","text":"PUPs are locations agreed to in advance by the leaders of armed forces and groups and the UN mission military component.

The assessment should identify the tolerable risk (the risk accepted by society in a given context based on current values), and then identify the protective measures necessary to achieve a residual risk (the risk remaining after protective measures have been taken). Risks related to women, youth, children, dependants and other specific-needs groups should also be considered. In developing this \u2018safe\u2019 working environment, it must be acknowledged that there can be no absolute safety and that many of the activities carried out during demobilization operations have a high risk associated with them. However, national authorities, international organizations and non-governmental organizations must try to achieve the highest possible levels of safety. Risks during demobilization operations may include: \\n Attacks on demobilization site personnel: The personnel who staff demobilization sites may be targeted by armed groups that have not signed on to the peace agreement. \\n Attacks on demobilized individuals: In some instances, peace agreements may cause armed groups to fracture, with some parts of the group opting to enter DDR while others continue fighting. In these instances, those who favour continued armed conflict may retaliate against individuals who demobilize. In some cases, active armed groups may approach demobilization sites with the aim of retrieving their former members. If demobilized individuals have already returned home, members of active armed groups may attempt to track these individuals down in order to punish or forcibly re-recruit them. The family members of the demobilized may also be subject to threats and attacks, particularly if they reside in areas where members of their family member\u2019s former group are still present. \\n Attacks on women and minority groups: Historically, SGBV against women and minority groups in cantonment sites has been high. It is essential that security and risk assessments take into consideration the specific vulnerabilities of women, identify minority groups who may also be at risk and provide additional security measures to ensure their safety. \\n Attacks on individuals transporting and receiving reinsertion support: Security risks are associated with the transportation of cash and commodities that can be easily seized by armed individuals. If it is known that demobilized individuals will receive cash and\/or commodities at a certain time and\/or place, it may make them targets for robbery. \\n Unrest and criminality: If armed groups remain in demobilization sites (particularly cantonment sites) for long periods of time, perhaps because of delays in the DDR programme, these sites may become places of unrest, especially if food and water become scarce. Demobilization delays can lead to mutinies by combatants and persons associated with armed forces and groups as they lose trust in the process. This is especially true if demobilizing individuals begin to feel that the State and\/or international community is reneging on previous promises. In these circumstances, demobilized individuals may resort to criminality in nearby communities or mount protests against demobilization personnel. \\n Recruitment: Armed forces and groups may use the prospect of demobilization (and associated reinsertion benefits) as an incentive to recruit civilians.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":1725}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"In criminal cases, what should be provided at all times according to specific needs?","answers":["Social support"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Children and DDR","text":"As with all decisions involving children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration when determining if a child should give information or testimony; however, under no circumstances shall a child be compelled to give testimony or a statement against himself or herself.

Costs can be prohibitive, and older youth may be pressured into employment. For those youth who do return to education, many experience diminished educational attainment.

Some resettlement countries do not take former combatants, with sometimes varying definitions of what exactly a former combatant is. Therefore, resettlement to a third coun\u00ad try is unlikely to be a viable option for large numbers of former combatants, although it may be a solution in individual cases.

There are four overall objectives of PI\/SC: \\n To inform stakeholders about the DDR process (public information): This includes providing tailored key messages to various stakeholders, such as where to go, when to deposit weapons, who is eligible for DDR and what reintegration options are available. The result is that DDR participants, beneficiaries and other stakeholders are made fully aware of what the DDR process involves. This kind of messaging also serves the purpose of making communities understand how the DDR process will involve them. Most importantly, it serves to manage expectations, clearly defining what falls within and outside the scope of DDR. If the DDR process is made up of different combinations of DDR programmes, DDR-related tools or reintegration support, messages should clearly define who is eligible for what. Given that, historically, women and girls have not always received the same information as male combatants, as they may be purposely hidden by male commanders or may have \u2018self-demobilized\u2019, it is essential that PI\/SC strategies take into consideration the specific information channels required to reach them. It is important to note, however, that PI activities cannot compensate for a faulty DDR process, or on their own convince people that it is safe to participate. If combatants are not willing to disarm, for whatever reason, PI alone will not persuade them to do so. In such sitatutions, strategic communications may be used to create the conditions for a successful DDR process. \\n To mitigate the negative impact of misinformation and disinformation (strategic communication): It is important to understand how conflict actors such as armed groups and other stakeholders respond, react to and\/or provide alternative messages that are disseminated in support of the DDR process. In the volatile conflict and post-conflict contexts in which DDR takes place, those who profit(ed) from war or who believe their political objectives have not been met may not wish to see the DDR process succeed. They may have access to radio stations from which they can make broadcasts or may distribute pamphlets and other materials spreading \u2018hate\u2019 or messages that incite violence and undermine the UN and\/or some of the (former) warring parties. These spoilers likely will have access to online platforms, such as blogs and social media, where they can easily reach and influence a large number of people. It is therefore critical that PI\/SC extends beyond merely providing information to the public. A comprehensive PI\/SC strategy shall be designed to identify and address sources of misinformation and disinformation and to develop tailored strategic communication interventions. Implementation should be iterative, whereby messages are deployed to provide alternative narratives for specific misinformation or disinformation that may hamper the implementation of a DDR process. \\n To sensitize members of armed forces and groups to the DDR process (strategic communication): Strategic communication interventions can be used to sensitize potential DDR participants. That is, beyond informing stakeholders, beneficiaries and participants about the details of the DDR process and beyond mitigating the negative impacts of misinformation and disinformation, strategic communication can be used to influence the decisions of individuals who are considering leaving their armed force or group including providing the necessary information to leave safely. The transformative objective of strategic communication interventions should be context specific and based on a concrete understanding of the political aspects of the conflict, the grievances of members of armed forces and groups, and an analysis of the potential motivations of individuals to join\/leave warring parties. Strategic communication interventions may include messages targeting active combatants to encourage their participation in the DDR process, for example, stories and testimonials from ex-combatants and other positive DDR impact stories. They may also include communication campaigns aimed at preventing recruitment. The potential role of the national authorities should also be assessed through analysis and where possible, national authorities should lead the strategic communication. \\n To transform attitudes in communities so as to foster DDR (strategic communication): Reintegration and\/or CVR programmes are often crucial elements of DDR processes (see IDDRS 2.30 on Community Violence Reduction and IDDRS 4.30 on Reintegration). Strategic communication interventions can help to create conditions that facilitate peacebuilding and social cohesion and encourage the peaceful return of former members of armed forces and groups to civilian life. Communities are not homogeneous entities, and individuals within a single community may have differing attitudes towards the return of former members of armed forces and groups. For example, those who have been hit hardest by the conflict may be more likely to have negative perceptions of returning combatants. Others may simply be happy to be reunited with family members. The DDR process may also be negatively perceived as rewarding combatants. When necessary, strategic communication can be used as a means to transform the perceptions of communities and to combat stigmatization, hate speech, marginalization and discrimination against former members of armed forces and groups. Women and girls are often stigmatized in receiving communities and PI\/SC can play a pivotal role in creating a more supportive environment for them. PI\/SC should also be utilized to promote non-violent behaviour, including engaging men and boys as allies in promoting positive masculine norms (see IDDRS 5.10 on Women, Gender and DDR). Finally, PI\/SC should also be used to destigmatize the mental health impacts of conflict and raise awareness of psychosocial support services.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":2606}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What does IDDRS 2.10 on The UN Approach to DDR set out the main principles that guide all aspects of DDR processes?","answers":["main principles"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Reintegration as Part of Sustaining Peace","text":"IDDRS 2.10 on The UN Approach to DDR sets out the main principles that guide all aspects of DDR processes.

DDR practitioners should also be aware that: \\n Youth participation in armed conflict is not always driven by negative motivations. Volunteerism into armed groups can be driven by a desire to change the social and political landscape in positive ways and to participate in something bigger than oneself. \\n Gender must be considered when considering reasons for youth engagement. Although an increasing number of young women and girls are involved in conflicts, particularly the longer conflicts continue, young men and boys are over-represented in armed forces and groups. This pattern is most often a result of societal gender expectations that value aggressive masculinity and peaceable femininity. While young women and girls often serve armed forces and groups in non- fighting roles and their contributions can be difficult to measure, their participation, reintegration and recovery is critical to peace building processes as marginalized women and girls remain at higher risk of (re)recruitment. Societal expectations may have implications for the roles of young women and men in conflict, as well as how they reintegrate following conflict (see IDDRS Module 5.10 Gender and DDR). It is important to understand the drivers for recruitment and re- recruitment, including the different challenges that male and female youth may experience.; \\n CVR and community-based reintegration programmes can be useful in preventing the (re-) recruitment of youth (see section 7.4 and IDDRS 2.30 on Community Violence Reduction and IDDRS 4.30 on Reintegration); \\n Young people can play a crucial role in preventing the spread of rumours that may fuel recruitment and armed conflict, particularly through social media.

These centres can also help with training and employment efforts by, for example, organizing job information fairs and providing referrals to employment services and counselling. Informal youth drop-in centres may also attract young former combatants who are vulnerable to re-recruitment, and who did not go through DDR because of fear or misinformation, or because they managed to escape and are looking for help by themselves.

ARVs are not a cure. \\n\\n Behaviour-change communication (BCC): A participatory, community-level process aimed at developing positive behaviours; promoting and sustaining individual, community and societal behaviour change; and maintaining appropriate behaviours. \\n\\n False negative\/positive: HIV test result that is wrong, either giving a negative result when the person is HIV-positive, or a positive result when the person is HIV-negative. \\n\\n HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\n HIV confirmation tests: According to WHO\/UNAIDS recommendations, all positive HIV- test results (whether ELISA [enzyme-linked immunabsorbent assay] or simple\/rapid tests) should be confirmed using a second, different test to confirm accuracy, or two further dif- ferent rapid tests if laboratory facilities are not available. \\n\\n HIV counselling: Counselling generally offered before and after an HIV test in order to help individuals understand their risk behaviour and cope with an HIV-positive result or stay HIV-negative. The counselling service also links individuals to options for treatment, care and support, and provides information on how to stay as healthy as possible and how to minimize the risk of transmission to others. Test results shall be confidential. Usually a vol- untary counselling and testing service package ensures that: the HIV test is voluntary; pre and post test counselling is offered; informed consent is obtained (agreement to a medical test or procedure after clear explanation of risks and benefits); and HIV tests are performed using approved HIV test kits and following testing protocols. \\n\\n HIV-negative result: The HIV test did not detect any antibodies in the blood. This either means that the person is not infected with the virus at the time of the test or that he\/she is in the \u2018window period\u2019 (i.e., false negative, see above). It does not mean that he\/she is immune to the virus. \\n\\n HIV-positive result: A positive HIV test result means that a person has the HIV antibodies in his\/her blood and is infected with HIV. It does not mean that he\/she has AIDS. HIV test: Usually a test for the presence of antibodies. There are two main methods of HIV testing: \\n HIV ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay) test: This is the most efficient test for testing large numbers per day, but requires laboratory facilities with equipment, maintenance staff and a reliable power supply; \\n Simple\/rapid HIV tests: These do not require special equipment or highly trained staff and are as accurate as ELISA. Rapid tests will usually give results in approximately 30 minutes and are easy to perform. Suitable combinations of three simple\/rapid tests are recommended by WHO where facilities for ELISA or ELISA\/Western Blot testing are not available. \\n\\n Inconclusive (indeterminate) result: A small percentage of HIV test results are inconclu- sive. This means that the result is neither positive nor negative. This may be due to a number of factors that are not related to HIV infection, or it can be because of the person is in the early stages of infection when there are insufficient HIV antibodies present to give a positive result. If this happens the test must be repeated. \\n\\n Information, education and communication (IEC): The development of communication strategies and support materials, based on formative research and designed to impact on levels of knowledge and influence behaviours among specific groups. \\n\\n Mandatory testing: Testing or screening required by federal, state, or local law to compel individuals to submit to HIV testing without informed consent. Within those countries that conduct mandatory testing, it is usually limited to specific \u2018populations\u2019 such as cat- egories of health care providers, members of the military, prisoners or people in high-risk situations. \\n\\n Nutritional requirements: AIDS patients usually need a food intake that is 30 percent higher than standard recommended levels. \\n\\n Opportunistic infection (OI): Infection that occurs when an immune system is weakened, but which might not cause a disease \u2014 or be as serious \u2014 in a person with a properly func- tioning immune system. \\n\\n Peer education: A popular concept that variously refers to an approach, a communication channel, a methodology and\/or an intervention strategy. Peer education usually involves training and supporting members of a given group with the same background, experience and values to effect change among members of that group. It is often used to influence knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours at the individual level. However, peer educa- tion may also create change at the group or societal level by modifying norms and stimulating collective action that contributes to changes in policies and programmes. Worldwide, peer education is one of the most widely used HIV\/AIDS awareness strategies. \\n\\n Post-exposure prophylaxis\/post-exposure prevention (PEP): A short-term antiretroviral treatment that reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure to infected body fluids, such as through a needle-stick injury or as a result of rape. The treatment should only be administered by a qualified health care practitioner. It essentially consists of taking high doses of ARVs for 28 days. To be effective, the treatment must start within 2 to 72 hours of the possible exposure; the earlier the treatment is started, the more effective it is. Its success rate varies. \\n\\n Routine opt-in testing: Approach to testing whereby the individual is offered an HIV test as a standard part of a treatment\/health check that he\/she is about to receive. The indivi- dual is informed that he\/she has the right to decide whether or not to undergo the test. \\n\\n Sentinel surveillance: Surveillance based on selected population samples chosen to repre- sent the relevant experience of particular groups. \\n\\n Sero-conversion: The period when the blood starts producing detectable antibodies in response to HIV infection. \\n\\n Sero-positive: Having HIV antibodies; being HIV-positive. \\n\\n Sexually transmitted infection (STI): Disease that is commonly transmitted through vaginal, oral or anal sex. The presence of an STI is indicative of risk behaviour and also increases the actual risk of contracting HIV. \\n\\n STI syndromic management: A cost-effective approach that allows health workers to diag- nose sexually transmitted infections on the basis of a patient\u2019s history and symptoms, without the need for laboratory analysis. Treatment normally includes the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. \\n\\n Universal precautions: Simple infection control measures that reduce the risk of transmis- sion of blood borne pathogens through exposure to blood or body fluids among patients and health care workers. Under the \u2018universal precaution\u2019 principle, blood and body fluids from all persons should be considered as infected with HIV, regardless of the known or supposed status of the person. \\n Use of new, single-use disposable injection equipment for all injections is highly recom- mended. Sterilising injection equipment should only be considered if single-use equip- ment is not available. \\n Discard contaminated sharps immediately and without recapping in puncture- and liquid-proof containers that are closed, sealed and destroyed before completely full. \\n Document the quality of the sterilization for all medical equipment used for percuta- neous procedures. \\n Wash hands with soap and water before and after procedures; use protective barriers such as gloves, gowns, aprons, masks and goggles for direct contact with blood and other body fluids. \\n Disinfect instruments and other contaminated equipment. \\n Handle properly soiled linen with care. Soiled linen should be handled as little as pos- sible. Gloves and leak-proof bags should be used if necessary. Cleaning should occur outside patient areas, using detergent and hot water. \\n\\n Voluntary HIV testing: A client-initiated HIV test whereby the individual chooses to go to a testing facility\/provider to find out his\/her HIV status. \\n\\n Window period: The time period between initial infection with HIV and the body\u2019s pro- duction of antibodies, which can be up to three months. During this time, an HIV test for antibodies may be negative, even though the person has the virus and can infect others.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":1593}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"DDR programs are often part of what type of programme?","answers":["a CPA"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Reintegration as Part of Sustaining Peace","text":"Efforts to support the transition of ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups into civilian life have typically taken place as part of post-conflict DDR programmes.

Such evaluations are valuable mechanisms that allow implementation strategies to be corrected early on in the programme implemen\u00ad tation process by identifying potential problems. This type of evaluation is particularly important for DDR processes, given their complex strategic arrangements and the many different sub\u00adprocesses involved. Most formative internal evaluations can be carried out internally by the M&E officer or unit within a DDR section; \\n Mid-term evaluations are similar to formative internal evaluations, but are usually more comprehensive and strategic in their scope and focus, as opposed to the more diag\u00ad nostic function of the formative type. Mid\u00adterm evaluations are usually intended to provide an assessment of the performance and outcomes of a DDR process for stake\u00ad holders, partners and donors, and to enable policy makers to assess the overall role of DDR in the broader post\u00adconflict context. Mid\u00adterm evaluations can also include early assessments of the overall contribution of a DDR process to achieving broader post\u00ad conflict goals; \\n Terminal evaluations are usually carried out at the end of the programme cycle, and are designed to evaluate the overall outcomes and effectiveness of a DDR strategy and programme, the degree to which their main aims were achieved, and their overall effec\u00ad tiveness in contributing to broader goals. Terminal evaluations usually also try to answer a number of key questions regarding the overall strategic approach and focus of the programme, mainly its relevance, efficiency, sustainability and effectiveness; \\n Ex-post evaluations are usually carried out some time (usually several years) after the end of a DDR programme in order to evaluate the long\u00adterm effectiveness of the programme, mainly the sustainability of its activities and positive outcomes (e.g., the extent to which ex\u00adcombatants remain productively engaged in alternatives to violence or mili\u00ad tary activity) or its direct and indirect impacts on security conditions, prospects for peace\u00adbuilding, and consequences for economic productivity and development. Ex\u00adpost evaluations of DDR programmes can also form part of larger impact evaluations to assess the overall effectiveness of a post\u00adconflict recovery strategy.

Impact indicators often use a composite set (or group) of indicators, each of which provides information on the size, sustainability and consequences of a change brought about by a DDR intervention.

Impact indicators depend on comprehensive and reliable baseline data, and should be as specific in possible in order to isolate the impact of DDR on complex social and economic dynamics from other factors and processes; \\n Proxy indicators: Cost, complexity and\/or the timeliness of data collection may prevent a result from being measured directly. In this case, proxy indicators \u2014 which are variables that substitute for others that are difficult to measure directly \u2014 may reveal performance trends and make managers aware of potential problems or areas of success.

\\n (vii) Combatants should not be considered as asylum\u00adseekers until the authorities have established within a reasonable timeframe that they have genuinely and permanently renounced military activities. Once this has been established, special procedures should be put in place for individual refugee status deter\u00ad mination, to ensure that those seeking asylum fulfil the criteria for the recogni\u00ad tion of refugee status.

In addition to these principles, the following general guiding principles related specifically to the legal framework apply when carrying out DDR processes. \\n Abide by the applicable legal framework. The applicable legal framework should be a core consideration at all stages, when drafting, designing, executing and evaluating DDR processes. Failure to abide by the applicable legal framework may result in consequences for the UN entity involved and the UN more generally, including possible liabilities. It may also lead to personal accountability for the DDR practitioner(s) involved. \\n Know your mandate. DDR practitioners should be familiar with the source and scope of their mandate. To the extent that their involvement in the DDR process requires coordination and\/or cooperation with other UN system actors, they should also know the respective roles and responsibilities of those other actors. If a peace agreement exists, it should be one of the first documents that DDR practitioners consult to understand the framework in which they will carry out the DDR process. \\n Develop a concept of operations (CONOPS). DDR practitioners should have a common, agreed approach in order to ensure coherence amongst UN system-supported DDR processes and coordination among the various UN system actors that are conducting DDR in a particular context. This can be achieved through a written CONOPS, developed in consultation, as necessary, with the relevant headquarters. The CONOPS can also be adjusted to include the legal obligations of the UN system actor. \\n Develop operation-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) or guidelines for DDR. Consistent with the CONOPS, DDR practitioners should consider developing operation-specific SOPs or guidelines. These may address, for instance, standards for cooperation with criminal justice and other accountability processes, measures for controlling access to DDR encampments or other installations, measures for the safe handling and destruction of weapons and ammunition, and other relevant issues. They may also include references to, and explanations of, the applicable legal standards. \\n Include legal considerations in all relevant project documents. In general, legal considerations should be integrated and addressed, as appropriate, in all relevant written project documents, including those agreed with the host State. \\n Seek legal advice. As a general matter, DDR practitioners should seek legal advice when they are in doubt as to whether a situation raises legal concerns. In particular, DDR practitioners should seek advice when they foresee new elements or significant changes in their DDR processes (e.g., when a new type of activity or new partners are involved). It is important to know where, and how, such advice may be requested and obtained. Familiarity with the legal office in-country and having clear channels of communication for seeking expeditious advice from headquarters are critical.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":2404}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What depends on the combined efforts of individuals, families and supporting communities to identify and work towards their own solutions?","answers":["The success of reintegration programmes"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Reintegration as Part of Sustaining Peace","text":"The success of reintegration programmes depends on the combined efforts of individuals, families and supporting communities to identify and work towards their own solutions.

Decisions associated with DDR contribute to defining central elements of the size and composition of a country\u2019s security sector while the gains from carefully executed SSR programmes can also generate positive consequences on DDR interventions. SSR may lead to downsizing and the conse- quent need for reintegration. DDR may also free resources for SSR.

If conducted sensitively, this can contribute to the legitimacy and sustainability of DDR programmes by helping to ensure that decisions are based on a nationally-driven assessment of applicable capacities, objectives and values.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":1783}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What does the Council condemn all acts of trafficking?","answers":["sale or trade in persons undertaken by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Le"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"DDR and Organized Crime","text":"Security Council Resolutions \\n The United Nations Security Council has increasingly recognized the role that organized crime and illicit markets play in sustaining and fuelling contemporary conflicts.

The Council condemns all acts of trafficking, particularly the sale or trade in persons undertaken by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da\u2019esh), and recognizes the importance of collecting and preserving evidence relating to such acts to ensure that those responsible can be held accountable. \\n\\n Security Council Resolution 2388 (2017) on trafficking in persons in armed conflict \\n This resolution recognizes \u201cthat trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict and post- conflict situations can be for the purpose of various forms of exploitation\u201d, including sexual exploitation and the recruitment of child soldiers.

ARVs are not a cure. \\n\\n Behaviour-change communication (BCC): A participatory, community-level process aimed at developing positive behaviours; promoting and sustaining individual, community and societal behaviour change; and maintaining appropriate behaviours. \\n\\n False negative\/positive: HIV test result that is wrong, either giving a negative result when the person is HIV-positive, or a positive result when the person is HIV-negative. \\n\\n HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\n HIV confirmation tests: According to WHO\/UNAIDS recommendations, all positive HIV- test results (whether ELISA [enzyme-linked immunabsorbent assay] or simple\/rapid tests) should be confirmed using a second, different test to confirm accuracy, or two further dif- ferent rapid tests if laboratory facilities are not available. \\n\\n HIV counselling: Counselling generally offered before and after an HIV test in order to help individuals understand their risk behaviour and cope with an HIV-positive result or stay HIV-negative. The counselling service also links individuals to options for treatment, care and support, and provides information on how to stay as healthy as possible and how to minimize the risk of transmission to others. Test results shall be confidential. Usually a vol- untary counselling and testing service package ensures that: the HIV test is voluntary; pre and post test counselling is offered; informed consent is obtained (agreement to a medical test or procedure after clear explanation of risks and benefits); and HIV tests are performed using approved HIV test kits and following testing protocols. \\n\\n HIV-negative result: The HIV test did not detect any antibodies in the blood. This either means that the person is not infected with the virus at the time of the test or that he\/she is in the \u2018window period\u2019 (i.e., false negative, see above). It does not mean that he\/she is immune to the virus. \\n\\n HIV-positive result: A positive HIV test result means that a person has the HIV antibodies in his\/her blood and is infected with HIV. It does not mean that he\/she has AIDS. HIV test: Usually a test for the presence of antibodies. There are two main methods of HIV testing: \\n HIV ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay) test: This is the most efficient test for testing large numbers per day, but requires laboratory facilities with equipment, maintenance staff and a reliable power supply; \\n Simple\/rapid HIV tests: These do not require special equipment or highly trained staff and are as accurate as ELISA. Rapid tests will usually give results in approximately 30 minutes and are easy to perform. Suitable combinations of three simple\/rapid tests are recommended by WHO where facilities for ELISA or ELISA\/Western Blot testing are not available. \\n\\n Inconclusive (indeterminate) result: A small percentage of HIV test results are inconclu- sive. This means that the result is neither positive nor negative. This may be due to a number of factors that are not related to HIV infection, or it can be because of the person is in the early stages of infection when there are insufficient HIV antibodies present to give a positive result. If this happens the test must be repeated. \\n\\n Information, education and communication (IEC): The development of communication strategies and support materials, based on formative research and designed to impact on levels of knowledge and influence behaviours among specific groups. \\n\\n Mandatory testing: Testing or screening required by federal, state, or local law to compel individuals to submit to HIV testing without informed consent. Within those countries that conduct mandatory testing, it is usually limited to specific \u2018populations\u2019 such as cat- egories of health care providers, members of the military, prisoners or people in high-risk situations. \\n\\n Nutritional requirements: AIDS patients usually need a food intake that is 30 percent higher than standard recommended levels. \\n\\n Opportunistic infection (OI): Infection that occurs when an immune system is weakened, but which might not cause a disease \u2014 or be as serious \u2014 in a person with a properly func- tioning immune system. \\n\\n Peer education: A popular concept that variously refers to an approach, a communication channel, a methodology and\/or an intervention strategy. Peer education usually involves training and supporting members of a given group with the same background, experience and values to effect change among members of that group. It is often used to influence knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours at the individual level. However, peer educa- tion may also create change at the group or societal level by modifying norms and stimulating collective action that contributes to changes in policies and programmes. Worldwide, peer education is one of the most widely used HIV\/AIDS awareness strategies. \\n\\n Post-exposure prophylaxis\/post-exposure prevention (PEP): A short-term antiretroviral treatment that reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure to infected body fluids, such as through a needle-stick injury or as a result of rape. The treatment should only be administered by a qualified health care practitioner. It essentially consists of taking high doses of ARVs for 28 days. To be effective, the treatment must start within 2 to 72 hours of the possible exposure; the earlier the treatment is started, the more effective it is. Its success rate varies. \\n\\n Routine opt-in testing: Approach to testing whereby the individual is offered an HIV test as a standard part of a treatment\/health check that he\/she is about to receive. The indivi- dual is informed that he\/she has the right to decide whether or not to undergo the test. \\n\\n Sentinel surveillance: Surveillance based on selected population samples chosen to repre- sent the relevant experience of particular groups. \\n\\n Sero-conversion: The period when the blood starts producing detectable antibodies in response to HIV infection. \\n\\n Sero-positive: Having HIV antibodies; being HIV-positive. \\n\\n Sexually transmitted infection (STI): Disease that is commonly transmitted through vaginal, oral or anal sex. The presence of an STI is indicative of risk behaviour and also increases the actual risk of contracting HIV. \\n\\n STI syndromic management: A cost-effective approach that allows health workers to diag- nose sexually transmitted infections on the basis of a patient\u2019s history and symptoms, without the need for laboratory analysis. Treatment normally includes the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. \\n\\n Universal precautions: Simple infection control measures that reduce the risk of transmis- sion of blood borne pathogens through exposure to blood or body fluids among patients and health care workers. Under the \u2018universal precaution\u2019 principle, blood and body fluids from all persons should be considered as infected with HIV, regardless of the known or supposed status of the person. \\n Use of new, single-use disposable injection equipment for all injections is highly recom- mended. Sterilising injection equipment should only be considered if single-use equip- ment is not available. \\n Discard contaminated sharps immediately and without recapping in puncture- and liquid-proof containers that are closed, sealed and destroyed before completely full. \\n Document the quality of the sterilization for all medical equipment used for percuta- neous procedures. \\n Wash hands with soap and water before and after procedures; use protective barriers such as gloves, gowns, aprons, masks and goggles for direct contact with blood and other body fluids. \\n Disinfect instruments and other contaminated equipment. \\n Handle properly soiled linen with care. Soiled linen should be handled as little as pos- sible. Gloves and leak-proof bags should be used if necessary. Cleaning should occur outside patient areas, using detergent and hot water. \\n\\n Voluntary HIV testing: A client-initiated HIV test whereby the individual chooses to go to a testing facility\/provider to find out his\/her HIV status. \\n\\n Window period: The time period between initial infection with HIV and the body\u2019s pro- duction of antibodies, which can be up to three months. During this time, an HIV test for antibodies may be negative, even though the person has the virus and can infect others.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":1593}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What is a key aspect of the assessment mission?","answers":["to understand the opportunities and problems posed by the unique political\/diplomatic"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Integrated DDR Planning: Processes and Structures","text":"A key aspect of the assessment mission is to understand the opportunities and problems posed by the unique political\/diplomatic, military and socio-economic context in the post- conflict society, and assess their implications for the planning and implementation of the DDR programme.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":2142}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What is important to manage the identification and separation of children from adults in a coordinated way during demobilization and throughout DDR?","answers":["children"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Children and DDR","text":"It is important to manage the identification and separation of children from adults in a coordinated way during demobilization, and throughout DDR.

Especially in situations where it is known that the host government has facilities for foreign combatants, some combatants may identify themselves voluntarily, either as part of military structures or individually. Providing information on the availability of internment camp facilities for foreign combatants may encourage self-identification. Groups of combatants from a country at war may negotiate with a host country to cross into its territory before actually doing so, and peacekeepers with a presence at the border may have a role to play in such negotiations. The motivation of those who identify themselves as combatants is usually either to desert on a long-term basis and perhaps to seek asylum or to escape the heat of battle temporarily. \\n Appearance. Military uniforms, weapons and arriving in troop formation are obvious signs of persons being combatants. Even where there are no uniforms or weapons, military and security officials of the host country will often be skilful at recognizing fellow military and security personnel \u2014 from appearance, demeanour, gait, scars and wounds, responses to military language and commands, etc. Combatants\u2019 hands may show signs of having carried guns, while their feet may show marks indicating that they have worn boots. Tattoos may be related to the various fighting factions. Combatants may be healthier and stronger than refugees, especially in situations where food is limited. It is important to avoid arbitrarily identifying all single, able-bodied young men as combatants, as among refugee influxes there are likely to be boys and young men who have been fleeing from forced military recruitment, and they may never have fought. \\n Security screening questions and luggage searches. Questions asked about the background of foreigners entering the host country (place of residence, occupation, circumstances of flight, family situation, etc.) may reveal that the individual has a military background. Luggage searches may reveal military uniforms, insignia or arms. Lack of belongings may also be an indication of combatant status, depending on the circumstances of flight. \\n Identification by refugees and local communities. Some refugees may show fear or wariness of combatants and may point out combatants in their midst, either at entry points or as part of relocation movements to refugee camps. Local communities may report the presence of strangers whom they suspect of being combatants. This should be carefully verified and the individual(s) concerned should have the opportunity to prove that they have been wrongly identified as combatants, if that is the case. \\n Perpetrators of cross-border armed incursions and attacks. Host country authorities may intercept combatants who are launching cross-border attacks and who pose a serious threat to the country.

In order for indicators to be meaningful, measurement must be made against a baseline, or baseline data, both of which are collected either in the context of the pre\u00adprogramme comprehensive assessment or during programme implementation. In general, most indicators should be developed together with the definition of programme activities, outputs, outcomes, objectives and goals. In general, indicators can be classified as follows: \\n Performance indicator: A particular characteristic or dimension used to measure intended changes defined by a programme results framework. Performance indicators are used to observe progress and to measure actual outputs and outcomes compared to those that were expected.

Impact indicators depend on comprehensive and reliable baseline data, and should be as specific in possible in order to isolate the impact of DDR on complex social and economic dynamics from other factors and processes; \\n Proxy indicators: Cost, complexity and\/or the timeliness of data collection may prevent a result from being measured directly.

The mapping was divided by categories of support and included applicable implementation timelines. The DDR\/SSR unit regularly distributed results to the wider international community. Several bilateral actors recognized the value of this initiative and highlighted that the DDR\/SSR unit had a comparative advantage in fulfilling this role because it had the human resources necessary to undertake such efforts.16 While coordination challenges among such a large number of actors is inevitable, ONUB\u2019s efforts has contributed to a more structured dialogue on these issues within the international community in Burundi.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":1888}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"How many core precepts is the Natural Resources Charter organized around?","answers":["12"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"DDR and Natural Resource Management","text":"Natural Resources Charter \\n The Natural Resource Charter is a set of principles for governments and societies on how to best harness the opportunities created by extractive resources for development.

The following list of organized crime\u2013related risks is intended to assist DDR practitioners to assess and manage vulnerabilities in such contexts in order to prevent negative consequences. \\n Programmatic risk: In contexts of ongoing conflict, organized crime activities can be used to further both economic and power-seeking gains. The risk that ex-combatants will be re- recruited or (continue to) engage in criminal activity is higher when conflict is ongoing, protracted or financed through organized crime. In the absence of a formal peace agreement, DDR participants may be more reluctant to give up the perceived opportunities that illicit activities offer, particularly when reintegration opportunities are limited, formal and informal economies overlap, and unresolved grievances persist. \\n \u2018Do no harm\u2019 risk: Because DDR processes not only present the risk of reinforcing illicit activities and flows, but may also be vulnerable to corruption and capture, DDR practitioners shall ensure that processes are implemented in a manner that avoids inadvertently contributing to illicit flows and\/or retaliation by armed forces and groups that engage in criminal activities. This includes the careful selection of partnering institutions and groups to implement DDR processes. Within an organized crime\u2013conflict context, DDR processes may also present the risk of reinforcing extortion schemes through the payment of cash\/stipends to DDR participants as part of reinsertion assistance. Practitioners should consider the distribution of payments through the issuance of pre-paid cards, vouchers or digital transfers where possible, to reduce the risk that participants will be extorted by those engaged in criminal activities, including armed forces and groups. \\n Security risk: The possibility of armed groups directly targeting staff\/programmes they may perceive as hostile is high in ongoing conflict contexts, particularly if DDR processes are perceived to be associated with the removal of livelihoods and social status. Conversely, DDR practitioners who are perceived to be supporting individuals (formerly) associated with criminal activities, particularly those who engaged in violence against local populations, can also be at risk of reprisals by certain communities or national actors. It is also important that potential risks to communities and civil society groups that may arise as a consequence of their engagement with DDR processes be properly assessed, managed and mitigated. \\n Reputational risk: DDR practitioners should be aware of the risk of being seen as promoting impunity or being lenient towards individuals who may have engaged in schemes of violent governance against communities. DDR practitioners should also be aware of the risk that they may be seen as being complicit in abusive State policies and\/or behaviour, particularly if armed forces are known to engage in organized criminal activities and pervasive corruption. Due diligence and appropriate frameworks, safeguards and mechanisms shall be applied to continuously address these complex issues. \\n Legal risks: DDR practitioners who rely on Government donors may face additional challenges if these Governments insert conditions or clauses into their grant agreements in order to comply with Security Council resolutions. As stated in IDDRS 2.11 on The Legal Framework for UN DDR, DDR practitioners should consult with their legal adviser if applicable host State national legislation criminalizes the provision of support, including to suspected terrorists or armed groups designated as terrorist organizations.

Prosecutions initiatives can vary. They can be broad in scope, aiming to try many perpetrators, or they can be narrowly focused on those that bear the most responsibility for the crimes committed. \\n Reparations \u2013 are a set of measures that provides redress for victims of gross violations of international human rights law, serious violations of international humanitarian law and violations of international criminal law. Reparations can take the form of restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. Reparations programs have two goals: first, to provide recognition for victims because reparation are explicitly and primarily carried out on behalf of victims; and, second, to encourage trust among citizens, and between citizens and the state, by demonstrating that past abuses are regarded seriously by the new government. \\n Truth commissions \u2013 are non-judicial or quasi-judicial fact-finding bodies. They have the primary purpose of investigating and reporting on past abuses in an attempt to understand the extent and patterns of past violations, as well as their causes and consequences. The work of a commission is to help a society understand and acknowledge a contested or denied history, and bring the voices and stories of victims to the public at large. It also aims at preventing further abuses. Truth commissions can be official, local or national. They can conduct investigations and hearings, and can identify the individuals and institutions responsible for abuse. Truth commissions can also be empowered to make policy and prosecutorial recommendations. \\n Institutional reform \u2013 is changing public institutions, including those that may have perpetuated a conflict or served a repressive regime, and transforming them into institutions that are more effective and accountable and thus better able to support the transition, sustain peace and preserve the rule of law. Following a period of massive human rights abuse, building fair and efficient public institutions play a critical role in preventing future abuses.

DDR practitioners should recognize that the rank-and-file members of armed forces and groups often receive information about DDR from their immediate commanders, who may have incentives to provide disinformation about DDR if they are reluctant for their subordinates to leave military life. \\n Rank-and-file of armed forces and groups: It is important to make the distinction between military leaderships, military commanders, mid-level commanders and their rank-and-file, because their motivations and interests may differ. Testimonials from the successfully demobilized and reintegrated rank-and-file have proven to be effective in informing their peers. Ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups can play an important role in amplifying messages aimed at demonstrating life after war. \\n Women associated with armed groups and forces in non-combat roles: It is important to cater to the information needs of WAAFAG, especially those who have been abducted. Communities, particularly women\u2019s groups, should also be informed about how to further assist women who manage to leave an armed force or group of their own accord. \\n Children associated with armed forces and groups: Individuals in this group need child-friendly, age- and gender-sensitive information to help reassure and safely remove those who are illegally held by an armed force or group. Communities, local authorities and police should also be informed about how to assist children who have exited or been released from armed groups, as well as about protocols to ensure the protection of children and their prompt handover to child protection services. \\n Ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups with disabilities: Information and sensitization to opportunities to access and participate in DDR should reach this group. Families and communities should also be informed on how to support the reintegration of persons with disabilities. \\n Youth at risk of recruitment: In countries affected by conflict, youth are both a force for positive change and, at the same time, a group that may be vulnerable to being drawn into renewed violence. When PI\/SC strategies focus only on children and mature adults, the specific needs and experiences of youth are missed. \\n Local authorities and receiving communities: Enabling the smooth reintegration of DDR participants into their communities is vital to the success of DDR.

Especially in situations where it is known that the host government has facilities for foreign combatants, some combatants may identify themselves voluntarily, either as part of military structures or individually. Providing information on the availability of internment camp facilities for foreign combatants may encourage self-identification. Groups of combatants from a country at war may negotiate with a host country to cross into its territory before actually doing so, and peacekeepers with a presence at the border may have a role to play in such negotiations. The motivation of those who identify themselves as combatants is usually either to desert on a long-term basis and perhaps to seek asylum or to escape the heat of battle temporarily. \\n Appearance. Military uniforms, weapons and arriving in troop formation are obvious signs of persons being combatants. Even where there are no uniforms or weapons, military and security officials of the host country will often be skilful at recognizing fellow military and security personnel \u2014 from appearance, demeanour, gait, scars and wounds, responses to military language and commands, etc. Combatants\u2019 hands may show signs of having carried guns, while their feet may show marks indicating that they have worn boots. Tattoos may be related to the various fighting factions. Combatants may be healthier and stronger than refugees, especially in situations where food is limited. It is important to avoid arbitrarily identifying all single, able-bodied young men as combatants, as among refugee influxes there are likely to be boys and young men who have been fleeing from forced military recruitment, and they may never have fought. \\n Security screening questions and luggage searches. Questions asked about the background of foreigners entering the host country (place of residence, occupation, circumstances of flight, family situation, etc.) may reveal that the individual has a military background. Luggage searches may reveal military uniforms, insignia or arms. Lack of belongings may also be an indication of combatant status, depending on the circumstances of flight. \\n Identification by refugees and local communities. Some refugees may show fear or wariness of combatants and may point out combatants in their midst, either at entry points or as part of relocation movements to refugee camps. Local communities may report the presence of strangers whom they suspect of being combatants. This should be carefully verified and the individual(s) concerned should have the opportunity to prove that they have been wrongly identified as combatants, if that is the case. \\n Perpetrators of cross-border armed incursions and attacks. Host country authorities may intercept combatants who are launching cross-border attacks and who pose a serious threat to the country. Stricter security and confinement measures would be necessary for such individuals.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":751}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"What does participation build confidence among ex-combatant groups?","answers":["improves the ability to meet the needs of vulnerable groups and helps strengthen links"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Food Assistance in DDR","text":"Although the extent to which any group participates should be decided on a case-by-case basis, even limited consultations, as long as they involve a variety of stakeholders, can improve the security of the food assistance component of a DDR process and increase the appropriateness of the assistance, distribution and monitoring.

Furthermore, DDR practitioners are not always properly trained to identify girls associated with or formerly associated with armed forces and groups and cater to their needs. Often, girls who informally leave armed forces or groups do so to avoid stigmatization or reprisal, or because they are unaware that they have the right to benefit from any kind of support. For these reasons, specific mechanisms should be developed to identify girls formerly associated with armed forces and groups and inform them about the benefits they may be entitled to through child-sensitive DDR processes. In order not to put girls at risk, this must be done in a sensitive manner, for example, through organizations and groups with which girls are already involved, such as health care facilities (particularly those dealing with reproductive health), religious centres and organizations that assist survivors of sexual violence (see IDDRS 5.10 on Women, Gender and DDR).","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":71}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"When should a peace agreement be signed?","answers":["as soon as possible"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Children and DDR","text":"The mechanisms and structures for the release and reintegration of children shall be set up as soon as possible and continue during ongoing armed conflict, before a peace agreement is signed, a peacekeeping mission is deployed, or a DDR process or security sector reform (SSR) process is established.","score":null,"title_score":null,"passage_id":22}],"negative_ctxs":null,"hard_negative_ctxs":null},{"dataset":"iddrs","question":"How will the intended audience vary according to the phase of the DDR process?","answers":["changes in people\u2019s attitudes"],"positive_ctxs":[{"title":"Public Information and Strategic Communication in Support of DDR","text":"The planning and implementation of the PI\/SC strategy shall acknowledge the diversity of stakeholders involved in the DDR process and their varied information needs.
